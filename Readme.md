## Getting Started

Here goes the instructions to get the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

To run this project You will need the following things installed on your machine

- NodeJS
- NPM
- Docker (Optional)

### Install Packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the Backend

### Run with Docker

It's super simple. If you already have Docker installed and running on your machine you can just run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

It will give you 3 things

1. The Express server in development mode (With hot reloading support)
2. A PostgreSQL database server (If you prefer something else like MySQL just make a couple of change inside the `docker-compose.yaml` file) The credentials are

```sh
DB_HOST = database-layer;
DB_NAME = dbname;
DB_USER = dbuser;
DB_PASSWORD = dbpassword;
```

3. A Database investigation tool named `Adminer` (You can inspect any kind of database from the browser) You can access it from `http://localhost:8080`

If you want to change or update any code you can just make the change and from the console you will see that the server is getting updated.

### Run without docker

If you don't use Docker then you will get an exception specifying you don't have any database.
TO avoid that you can do 2 things.

1. First go inside the `.env.development` file and specify the following variables of a database server that you are using.

```
DB_HOST=database-layer
DB_NAME=dbname
DB_USER=dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=dbpassword
```

2. Otherwise go inside the `index.ts` file and on line number 29 comment of the following line

```js
dbClient = await connection.sync();
```

## Run the Frontend

### Prerequisites

Install `nvm`:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```
 
Install the latest LTS `node`: (for example)
```bash
nvm install v14.16.1
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install `yarn` globally:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Install Packages

```bash
yarn install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
